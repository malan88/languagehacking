Language Hacking
================

This repo is going to keep track of all of the things and resources I learn
about learning languages. In the beginning it will be very terse, but I hope to
expand it. There is a ton of language hacking material online but nothing overly
definitive or comprehensive.

There are three categories for now:

1. Resources
    - apps
    - sites
    - youtube channels
    - dictionaries, etc., etc.
2. Methods: the ways one can learn a lanaguage, etc.
3. Tricks: little methods that boost the speed of learning
4. Articles: special articles/videos that discuss ways to learn faster.

So anyway, very uninformative pour le moment, mais je peux ajouter et affiner
plus tard.
