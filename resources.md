Primary Resources
=================

The six most foundational resources for language learning in the 21st Century, I am
convinced, are anki, anki, anki, italki, italki, and italki.

I cannot stress this enough. I believe they are the two most important
inventions in language learning in the past two thousand years. Crazy.

I have also been using memrise, which I can't overly-recommend (I got a year for
$30 where it usually goes for $60), because I believe it's not extensible
enough, but I can say it is useful for hearing native-level pronunciation of the
words. There are seven french levels and I'm a little bit into the second. It
works, it's essentially pre-made spaced repitition flash cards in special ways.
one of the problems with it is that it overemphasizes multiple choice which I
believe is not the most efficient way to learn, and it also has this bad habit
of not showing you the spelled out words every time. Sometimes when I come back
to a word or phrase, I can hear and understand what is being said, but I can't
remember how to spell it and I run into this problem of having to look it up
when the flash card should just show me even if I get it right.

Another indispensible resource is translate.google.com and the Google Translate
app. I don't really care about how you feel about Google as a company, because I
probably hate them more than you, but Google Translate is a godsend. Obviously
don't translate every sentence and expect to learn from it, but it is very
helpful in getting (a) single word immediate translations/definitions and (b)
getting the sense of a brief phrase that might have some idiomatic meaning.
(Earlier I watched an interview in French with a pop star and had to translate
"Qu'est-ce que t'a fait exploser?" which has the sense of "What made you blow
up?" I didn't quite know exploser but translating that sentence made the sense
of it completely obvious and I added it to anki. Then she said "Vous ne vous y
attendiez pas à celle-là," which translate helped me figure out was "You didn't
exect that."

One of the biggest problems with google translate is that it doesn't show as
much grammatical information as I'd like, especially gender. You can retype the
word in english to hopefully get a translation from "the word" to hopefully get
your target word with the article, but it might decide another word is closer.
Another problem is sometimes conjugation. I have used Google Translate to figure
out the infinitive of a word that I don't recognize, but it is subpar for this
purpose (it's only benefit is convenience, especially if you have translate in
context set up on your telephone and wordeys on your browser, which I will
discuss in a minute).

So for more nuanced results, use something like wordreference.com or
context.reverso.net, which is just as useful. wordreference.com will give you
conjugations as well. So if you search for a random form, like "aimerais", it
will point you to the first/second person singular conditional of aimer. Other
apps do that as well, and often you can find piggy back apps. That is to say,
I'm using an app that piggy backs off of fr.wiktionary.com, which is a very
extensive french dictionary (it is all in French, though, so that can sometimes
be a pain for obvious reasons).

Wordreference.com is awesome. Totally amazing, especially for the forum. It is
quite often as I talk to myself (a very useful strategy in language learning)
that I wonder if a French word or phrase has the sense of something that I
realize might be idiomatic to English. There are several other resources that
can help with this, but, for instance, I wondered if drôle had the same sense of
"bizarre" or "weird" as funny does, which, indeed, it does, according to a
reddit thread I found. (reddit.com/r/french seems to answer these sorts of
questions as well).

Another resource I've used twice now is french.stackexchange.com. There are a
few stackexchange's for languages, including:

- spanish.stackexchange.com
- french.stackexchange.com
- german.stackexchange.com
- chinese.stackexchange.com
- russian.stackexchange.com is mostly in English
- rus.stackexchange.com is mostly in Cyrillic Russian
- english.stackexchange.com is really more for native English speakers to get a
  better understanding of the many grammatical quirks of English
- ell.stackexchange.com stands for English Language Learners, for ESL
- italian.stackexchange.com
- portuguese.stackexchange.com
- latin.stackexchange.com
- korean.stackexchange.com
- esperanto.stackexchange.com
- ukrainian.stackexchange.com
- languagelearning.stackexchange.com for general language learning (like this
  resource I'm writing right now
- conlang.stackexchange.com for constructed languages

These resources have varying levels of engagement and you might find, depending
on the language you are trying to learn, that you are better off with another
network entirely (e.g., Reddit, Quora, etc., etc.)

But I have found, at least for French, the French SE to be extremely useful,
with much friendlier users than most other SE's (i.e., stackoverflow.com,
indispensible for programming and with which I am extremely familiar). For
example, I asked
[this](https://french.stackexchange.com/questions/37465/en-conversation-une-utilisation-particuli%c3%a8re-de-comprendre/37467#37467)
question on the French SE and got an answer promptly and was even upvoted about
the spoken nuances of the phrase "I understand that..." to an English speaker.

Another resource I find useful occasionally is youglish.com, which I discovered
via Hacker News somehow. Essentially it searches through subtitles of YouTube
videos for the words you search for and serves you that bit of videos so you can
hear how natives pronounce the words. Sometimes it's more useful than other
times, as I couldn't get it to recognize the difference between "là" and "la" so
I could hear the difference (answer: there isn't one), but at other times it's
extremely useful.

Of course YouTube is perhaps the greatest resource I have found yet. Of course
there are different channels that are worth watching or not, this comes down to
searching and looking for the language. I'll list some of my favorite ones so
far in French, but truth be told, it's best just to read a lot of articles and
talk to people to find out the better ones. Plus there are a ton of TED talks by
polyglots about different methods. (Newsflash: there are as many polyglots
claiming they have the secret to learning languages fast as there are
infomercials claiming to have the secret to losing weight fast).

If you don't have the Wikipedia app installed on your phone yet you might want
to do that now. And as soon as you do add a second language that is your target
language. This is great practice, especially for intermediate students, because
you get better in-language understanding of different concepts. I have
researched French movies, songs, and people in the French Wikipedia. I can tell
you a couple things I have learned about the French in general just from doing
that: they have a greater appreciation for the work people do to make movies and
they are more interested in ideas than people. To explain: every French Wiki on
a film lists the full credits, where the English wiki just typically lists the
director and the cast (and occasionally mentions the writer, etc.). Furthermore,
whereas if I search Heidegger in English I get mostly people and things (Martin
Heidegger, Heideggerian terminology, and then a long succession of books), if I
search for him in French I get a wealth of articles I really want to read:

- Heidegger et la question du temps
- Heidegger et la métaphysique
- Heidegger et la théologie
- Heidegger et le nazisme
- Heidegger et la phénoménologie
- Heidegger et la question de la technique
- Heidegger et la question de l'existence
- Heidegger et Aristote

I mean, the list just goes on and on. I love it. Je l'adore.

Finally, a resource I just discovered yesterday was listeningpractice.org. It
has a wonderful verb conjugation game/test/practice system that I'm now using.
It's tests kind of suck though. I mean seriously hard. French is notorious for
being difficult to listen to (because they pronounce about half of their
syllables), but this was ridiculous.

More resources will be added to this as I go.
